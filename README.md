[ImmutableJS][] decorator for [redux-storage][]. Use this to convert the loaded
state tree (or parts of it) into a [ImmutableJS][] structure.

# Moved to the react-stack organisation

My focus has left the node / react ecosystem and this module has got a new home
over at [react-stack](https://github.com/react-stack/redux-storage-decorator-immutablejs)!

## Installation

    npm install --save redux-storage-decorator-immutablejs

## Usage

Simply wrap your engine in this decorator and list all keys (or key path) that
should be converted.

```js
import immutablejs from 'redux-storage-decorator-immutablejs'

engine = immutablejs(engine, [
    ['immutablejs-reducer'],
    ['plain-object-reducer', 'with-immutablejs-key']
]);
```
